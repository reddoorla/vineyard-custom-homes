# Vineyard Custom Homes — Work Journal

Running log of build work: what was done, why, and where it landed.
Chronological — newest entry at the bottom. [README.md](../README.md) says what
the stack is and how to run it; this is the history of getting it there.

The convention is in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) under "The work journal". In
short: every working session appends a dated entry, prose over bullets, why
over what, and history is never edited to be right — a later entry corrects an
earlier one and says so.

## 2026-09-05 — Journal opened, and 111 commits summarised rather than reconstructed (`chore/work-journal`)

The journal starts today, so this first entry is a **backfill**: a coarse
summary read off the commit log, not written from memory. Detail below this
line is trustworthy; detail above it is not, and nothing here should be cited
as though someone recorded it at the time. For anything before 2026-09-05 the
commit log is the record.

**What this repo is.** The marketing site for Vineyard Custom Homes, a custom
home builder in Eagle, Idaho — SvelteKit 5 on Prismic and Tailwind v4, deployed
to Netlify. Home, about, contact, a gallery with per-project pages, and a
`[uid]` catch-all. 111 commits, 2025-05-08 to 2026-09-01.

**The eras, and they are sharp.** 2025 is the build: 36 commits between May and
September, with messages like `first commit`, `auto`, `cleaned up half height`,
`changes from tim` — a site made by hand, client rounds landing straight on
`main`. Then **nothing between 2025-09-08 and 2026-05-20**: eight months dark.

What ended the gap was not feature work. **June 2026 carries 43 commits, the
biggest month by far, and nearly all of it is this site being pulled into the
fleet** — eleven `chore: sync … from @reddoorla/maintenance` commits on
2026-06-04 alone (eslint, prettier, ci, renovate, netlify, lighthouse,
playwright-a11y), `jsconfig` → `tsconfig`, the `/dev/a11y-fixtures` route, and
two review PRs clearing what canonical tooling surfaced: a gallery build crash,
dynamic-route 404s, a slice migration. The rest of June is the same
consolidation by other means — Node 24 and pnpm 11, FontAwesome replaced with
`@lucide/svelte`, Typekit moved onto the shared kit `noj4tji`, the contact form
taken off Netlify Forms onto central ingest.

July and August are operational, not visual: `/health`, a smoke suite,
enrolment in the fleet form-e2e probe, Turnstile on the contact form, then a
long dependency run (vite 8, typescript 6, prettier-plugin-svelte 4). The last
two commits are reusable CI v1.4.1 and #59, which capped Prismic srcset widths
and gave every image a real `sizes`.

**One thing the log implies wrongly.** This site only ever grew two Prismic
slices, `RichText` and `ContentWidthMedia`. Everything that looks like a slice
elsewhere in the fleet is a component under `src/lib/components/` here — it was
built before the shared slice library existed and was never retrofitted.

**State as of this entry.** `main` at `49d2fde`, tree clean, nothing in flight.
The README is stale in two checkable ways: it claims Vite 6 and Node 22, while
`package.json` is on Vite 8 and both `.nvmrc` and `netlify.toml` say Node 24.

## 2026-10-04 — Off Slice Machine, onto the Prismic CLI (reddoor-maintenance#1090)

Phase 4 of the fleet migration (reddoor-maintenance#1090), following the
espada port. Slice Machine is deprecated by Prismic since 2026-09-18; models
are now edited in the Type Builder and the generated files come from
`pnpm prismic:gen`. `prismic.config.json` replaces `slicemachine.config.json`,
which two files read: `src/lib/prismicio.js` and `vite.config.js`'s `fs.allow`.

**The types file moved, and the imports followed it.** The CLI writes
`prismicio-types.d.ts` at the project root, outside SvelteKit's `src/**`
include. Unlike espada, six files here import the types by relative path (both
slices, `ProjectImage.svelte`, and three gallery route files), so moving each
path up one level keeps the file in the program and no `app.d.ts` import is
needed. `svelte-check` was 0 errors / 10 warnings before and after. A probe
calling `getByUID("definitely_not_a_type", …)` failed with the seven-type
union, so the client is still typed rather than silently `any`.

**A stale model, found by regenerating.** The new types add
`FormRepliesDocument` and `FormRepliesDocumentDataRepliesItem`: the committed
Slice Machine types predated `customtypes/form_replies` (18 exported names
before, 20 after; the slice index's two entries are unchanged). The comment in
`src/lib/server/reply-copy.ts` said `form_replies` was absent from the union;
it no longer is, so the comment now says how a type gets into it. The cast it
explains is still needed for a `(type: string)` reader.

**No framing change was needed.** The site passes no `csp` to the central
config, has no `hooks.server`, and `netlify.toml` sets no headers. Measured
from `vite preview`: `/slice-simulator` (prerendered), `/`, `/about`,
`/gallery`, `/health` and `/contact` (both server-rendered) send neither
X-Frame-Options nor a CSP. Live on www.vineyardconstruction.com,
`/slice-simulator`, `/`, `/about` and `/health` send neither either. The same
grep found `x-frame-options` on google.com, so it can see the header.

**An instrument that answered for someone else.** The first preview
measurement showed CSP `frame-ancestors 'self'` and `X-Frame-Options:
SAMEORIGIN` on server-rendered routes, which nothing in this repo sets. The
port was already taken by another process: `--strictPort` made this site's
preview exit, and curl reached the other server. Re-run on a port that
answered nothing beforehand, with the preview's own log showing it listening.

**The codegen gate's local mutation needs a commit.** Deleting an entry from
`src/lib/slices/index.ts` in the working tree left the local gate GREEN,
because regenerating overwrote the hand edit back to HEAD's file. Committed
first (as it would be in a PR), the same mutation went RED. Model mutations
(a field added to the RichText slice, a field added to `project`) went RED
uncommitted, since the model itself stays changed.

The nightly drift sweep read this site's 9 models as matching Prismic at
`965fe9e`, the base of this change, so nothing was owed to Prismic first.
